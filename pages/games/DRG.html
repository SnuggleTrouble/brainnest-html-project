      <h2>WELCOME, NEW MINER!</h2>
      <i>A letter from Management:</i>
      <p>
        Congratulations, [NEW DWARVEN EMPLOYEE]! By signing up with DEEP ROCK
        GALACTIC, you have just taken your first step towards becoming an
        essential gear in the machine of the MOST TENACIOUS space mining
        corporation in the known galaxy!
      </p>
      <p>
        At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC, we pride ourselves on having established
        practical dominance of some the most lucrative systems in the OUTER RIM.
        While our foolish and cowardly competitors generally regard these as too
        volatile or high-risk, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC calls them home.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, we have a total of 89 ORBITAL SPACE RIGS in operation
        throughout MORE THAN A DOZEN Outer Rim systems, with 16 MORE currently
        under construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, a NEW MANDATE is upon us! While our digs number in the dozens
        already, we are currently engaged in our most daring and heavily
        orchestrated mining operation to date: The COMPLETE SUBJUGATION of the
        planet HOXXES IV.
      </p>
      <p>
        HOXXES IV constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the SINGLE MOST
        LUCRATIVE mining location in the galaxy, containing the RICHEST AND MOST
        DENSE concentrations of valuable minerals we have ever encountered.
        However, it also just happens to be the SINGLE MOST HOSTILE place we
        have ever mapped. Several competitors before us have tried to tame
        Hoxxes IV, WITHOUT LUCK.
      </p>
      <p>
        DEEP ROCK GALACTIC will succeed. DEEP ROCK GALACTIC is not in the
        business of failing.
      </p>
      <p>MANAGEMENT BIDS YOU WELCOME, NEW MINER. WELCOME ABOARD.</p>

      <h2>WORKING AT DEEP ROCK GALACTIC</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>TEAMWORK IS KEY</strong><br />
        At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC we value TEAMWORK above all else! The sheer
        hostility of Hoxxes IV means anyone caught away from their team will be
        in for a world of hurt. As a responsible INTERPLANETARY MINING
        CONGLOMERATE, we depend on our employees to take care of each other. In
        other words - we won't be there holding your hand.<br />
        As the saying goes: <i>"Dig together - or dig your own grave"</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NEXT-LEVEL SPACE MINING</strong><br />
        At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC we specialise in SPACE MINING at the most
        dangerous dig sites in the galaxy, and we call upon those with a natural
        predisposition towards hard, honest work!<br />
        We believe in LEAN MINING, and we expect the same of you. Why send in a
        massive and costly mining operation when a CRACK SQUAD of highly-skilled
        mining operatives will do?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>MYSTERIOUS CAVES</strong><br />
        At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC we say that any cave can be conquered, so long as
        our drills remain fueled and lubricated!<br />
        While no two caves will ever be the same, our dedicated RESEARCH
        DEPARTMENT is constantly at work peeling apart the tectonic layers of
        the planet, locating the most lucrative caves and categorizing them
        accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>MOVE UP THE COMPANY LADDER</strong><br />
        At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC we are big on PROMOTIONS! So big, in fact, that we
        tally up EVERYTHING you do and calculate your Rank based on that!<br />
        Upon first joining us, your Rank will be 0 (lovingly referred to as
        Greenbeards among the employees). You will not remain a Greenbeard for
        long, however - while your objectives will carry you ever further down,
        your standing within the company will only go up!*<br />
        * Provided, of course, you are fortunate and skilled enough to survive.

      <h2>OPERATION: SUBJUGATE HOXXES</h2>
      <p>
        Hoxxes IV is SO RICH IN MINERALS that our database of exploitable cave
        systems practically doubles on a weekly basis! But, thanks to the
        TIRELESS EFFORTS of the Research & Development branch, so too does our
        understanding of the extremely hostile flora and fauna found there. To
        prepare you for some of the risks that you'll be facing on the planet,
        we have prepared a SMALL BRIEFING - we advise you to read it closely.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>WHY DWARVES?</strong><br />
        While the operations of DEEP ROCK GALACTIC goes all across the spectrum
        when it comes to operating specs, there are some that absolutely stand
        out. And when it comes to the MOST DANGEROUS DIGS, we have long relied
        on the tenacity, strength, and sheer underground survivability of the
        stout DWARVES.<br />
        It is a simple fact of life - when you're attempting to establish a
        profitable mining operation on the most hostile planet in the galaxy,
        sometimes things don't go to plan. And when all other measures have
        failed - a mine suddenly gone dark, or a particularly heavy alien
        infestation is uncovered - that is when we send in the DWARVES.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>THE MOST DANGEROUS PLANET IN THE GALAXY?</strong><br />
        This is not hyperbole. DEEP ROCK GALACTIC has had their eyes on this
        awful rock for a long time, because it is so unreasonably rich in
        valuable and rare materials. The problem, however, is that it is also
        the home of one of the most dense and diverse collections of hostile
        alien flora and fauna ever encountered.<br />
        It is an ugly planet. A bug planet. A planet of plutonium-fanged worms
        that would like nothing better than to take up residence in your sinus
        cavities.<br />
        What we are saying is this: Hoxxes IV is a very bad place.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>SO HOW ARE YOU MEANT TO SURVIVE DOWN THERE?</strong><br />
        Let it never be said that DEEP ROCK GALACTIC spares any expense on
        equipment! Our Dwarven miners are consistently decked out with the
        heaviest, most reliable weapons, and the most advanced and ingenious
        gadgets this side of Rigel VII, and we are proud of this fact.<br />
        From industrial flamethrowers, to experimental plasma chargers, to
        launchers firing climbable concrete platforms into walls - if the lads
        in R&D can dream it up, the Dwarves will have access to it!
