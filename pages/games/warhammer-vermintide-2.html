      <h2>What is Vermintide 2?</h2>
      <p>
        Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed
        Vermintide. The time has arrived to revisit the fierce first-person
        co-op slaughter-fest featuring visceral and ground breaking melee
        action, set in the apocalyptic End Times of the war-ravaged Warhammer
        Fantasy Battles world.

      <h2>The Heroes Return</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>5 Heroes, 15 Careers</strong>
        <br />
        The five Heroes of Ubersreik are back for more blood-splattering battles
        against overwhelming odds. The 15 unique careers provide different
        playstyles and add variety and depth to character progression. Each
        career has an insectionidual talent tree, active and passive abilities,
        and access to unique weapons and equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Markus Kruber</strong>
        <br />
        Arriving in the Skaven infested ruins of Ubersreik all alone, and with
        no misfit band of Skaven-slayers allowing him to vent his rage, Kruber
        would have had to face the devastating loss of his family all by
        himself. At first, he was wary and distant towards the others, but along
        the way, Kruber did warm up to his fellow fighters and schools of
        thought.
        <br />
        Play as <i>Foot Knight</i>, <i>Huntsman</i> or <i>Mercenary</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bardin Goreksson</strong>
        <br />
        Bardin is an unstoppable avalanche on the battlefield, an ale-swigging
        hurricane at the inn, and a steadfast friend by the campfire. Driven by
        his search for the lost dwarfen hold of Karak Zorn, Bardin has been
        somewhat side-tracked by the ceaseless Skaven interference. Yet he stays
        true to his spirit, fighting the good fight as a hero whose deeds do his
        ancestors proud!
        <br />
        Play as <i>Ranger Veteran</i>, <i>Ironbreaker</i> or <i>Slayer</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Kerillian</strong>
        <br />
        Like all wood elves, Kerillian feels the pull of both light and dark.
        First, as a Waywatcher, and now as a more experienced Waystalker, she
        has kept those aspects in balance. Indeed, Kerillian's reason for
        journeying to Ubersreik was an attempt to help her reclaim her moral
        poise.
        <br />
        Play as <i>Shade</i>, <i>Waystalker</i>, or <i>Handmaiden</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Victor Saltzpyre</strong>
        <br />
        Never the easiest of comrades, Victor Saltzpyre has shown little sign of
        mellowing since the early days of the Ubersreik invasion. Though it is
        hardly in his nature to trust such outcasts as are his companions in
        these dark days, he accepts that righteous work can sometimes be
        accomplished by stained souls and soiled hands.
        <br />
        Play as <i>Bounty Hunter</i>, <i>Witch Hunter Captain</i> or
        <i>Zealot</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sienna Fuegonasus</strong>
        <br />
        Sienna Fuegonasus is an addict, forever torn between her will to control
        the destructive magics of Aqshy - the Wind of Fire - and a burgeoning
        desire to set the world alight for no other reason than the rush of
        magic in her bones.
        <br />
        Play as <i>Battle Wizard</i>, <i>Pyromancer</i> or <i>Unchained</i>.
      </p>

        talent tree, allowing you to spec your Hero to best suit your playstyle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Abilities</strong>
        <br />
        The Heroes are bolstered with one active and passive ability, each
        unique for every career. Abilities can be crucial in turning the tide of
        a battle, so learn to use them effectively to increase the killing
        capacity and survival chance of your team.
