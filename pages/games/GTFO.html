    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <p>
        GTFO is an extreme cooperative horror shooter where fighting for
        survival in a nightmare world throws you from gripping suspense to
        explosive action in a heartbeat. Teamwork is your only hope. Work
        together or die together.

    <!-- The Prisoners -->
    <section>
      <h2>THE PRISONERS</h2>
      <p>
        You're imprisoned in Hydrostasis, a lifeless sleep that obliterates
        memory. When you awaken, only fragments of your criminal past remain.
        It's instinct that keeps you alive, and it's telling you that survival
        in the Complex means working together. Listen to it or die.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trusting your teammates won't be easy. Instinct tells you they've fought
        by your side before, but with your memory destroyed, you can't be sure.
        Still, deep down, you know that the only way to survive this mission is
        to rely on them - but can they rely on you?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>WOODS, ISAIAH F-2056</strong>
        <br />
        Isaiah Woods was a religious man of honor and courage who saw too much.
        The brutality of combat changed him from a spiritual man to a ticking
        time bomb. When his fuse finally burned down, he went on a rampage and
        justified it as divine retribution for the evils he saw around him. Even
        now, with no memory of the carnage he wrought, he feels the presence of
        God flowing through him. Some fires burn too deep to smother.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DAUDA, ABEO T-3701</strong>
        <br />
        A brilliant young mind. A groundbreaking researcher. A pillar of the
        scientific community. Nigerian-born psychopharmacologist Abeo Dauda was
        all of those things before his obsessive ambition broke his moral
        compass. Dauda's blindness to the human cost of his experiments made him
        indispensable to unscrupulous drug companies. As long as they stayed out
        of his way, he didn't question them. By the time he realized the
        depravity of the people he worked for, it was too late.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>HACKETT, AIDEN O-4711</strong>
        <br />
        The first person to admit Hackett isn't cut out for this world is
        Hackett. Even as a child, his feral mind was a deadly force. When he
        joined the military, discipline loosened the grip of his dark impulses,
        but nature always finds a way. Inevitably, Hackett's instinctive cruelty
        was unleashed on a peacekeeping mission that couldn't have gone more
        wrong. Clear-eyed about his actions, Hackett knew that redemption would
        cost him life as he knew it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>BISHOP, FRANK GO-1395 </strong>
        <br />
        A lifetime ago, Frank Bishop made a losing bet. He'd robbed, kidnapped,
        and trafficked in a bid for fortune and power. This time, it was
        blackmail, but things didn't go to plan. His target turned the tables,
        condemning him to years of brutal captivity. The torture and deprivation
        he endured ended with Bishop suffering an even worse fate: Hydrostasis.
        Now, unable to remember the man who destroyed him, he's left with only
        the rage and mistrust that sustained his tragic existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4-PRISONER TEAMS</strong>
        <br />
        It doesn't matter where they're from or how they got on your team. What
        matters is that there are four of you and that you trust each other.
        Fill your lineup with friends, but if you need another ally or two, AI
        prisoner bots can complete your crew.

    <!-- The Creatures -->
    <section>
      <h2>THE CREATURES</h2>
      <p>
        Don't wake them up. Their kill instinct is unstoppable. If one of them
        knows you're there, they all know, and they won't stop coming until
        you're dead. Swarms aren't easy to survive, so plan every move, pull
        your weight, and watch your step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things change in a heartbeat in the Complex. Creatures may be dormant,
        but let your focus drop, and these Sleepers will descend in wave after
        relentless wave. Tactical planning and communication are essential for
        your team's survival when things go wrong. And they will. They always
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>STAY ALERT</strong>
        <br />
        Born in the pitch-black belly of the Complex, Sleepers await the hunt
        blind, silent, and ready. Anything can set them off. A heavy footstep.
        The distant retort of a weapon. A beam of light. Know where they are
        before they know you're even there. Rely on your senses and use a
        bio-tracker if you've got one to stealth your way through the Complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CARRY A BIG STICK</strong>
        <br />
        Use your melee weapon to take out Sleepers before they wake up and alert
        the horde. Clear it with your team before you take an enemy out, even if
        you think you've got it covered. If you fail to get the job done, you'll
        all need to retreat to a defendable area before the hive awakens.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>FIGHT LIKE HELL</strong>
        <br />
        You'll need heavy weaponry and a clear mind when things go wrong - and
        they will. Check your line of fire, force them through bottlenecks, set
        up your kill zones, and reload every chance you get. These creatures
        stop at nothing, and neither should you. Once the mayhem starts, you
        have no choice but to put every last one of them down.

    <!-- The Complex -->
    <section>
      <h2>THE COMPLEX</h2>
      <p>
        The Complex is a masterpiece of underground engineering, but they dug
        too deep. Evil swept through its twisting network of tunnels and
        caverns, leaving behind the echoes of life and a stench of death. Now,
        every level of the Complex has become the hunting grounds of diabolical
        creatures.
