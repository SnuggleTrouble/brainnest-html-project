      <h2>THE ULTIMATE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL RPG</h2>
      <p>
        Project Zomboid is the ultimate in zombie survival. Alone or in MP: you
        loot, build, craft, fight, farm and fish in a struggle to survive. A
        hardcore RPG skillset, a vast map, massively customisable sandbox and a
        cute tutorial raccoon await the unwary. So how will you die? All it
        takes is a bite..
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>SURVIVE</strong>
        <br />
        Surviving isn't just about blowing zombie heads off. Depression,
        starvation, loneliness, infection... Just some of the things to deal
        with...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>BUILD</strong>
        <br />
        Craft items to help you stay alive. Whether it's weapons, food or a
        plank of wood nailed to a door...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DEFEND</strong>
        <br />
        Protect yourself and your allies from the relentless horde with a huge
        range of weapons and defenses.
      </p>
