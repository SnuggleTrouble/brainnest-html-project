    <section>
      <p>
        <strong>Valheim</strong> is a brutal exploration and survival game for
        1-10 players set in a procedurally-generated world inspired by Norse
        mythology. Craft powerful weapons, construct longhouses, and slay mighty
        foes to prove yourself to Odin!

        <strong>EXPLORE THE TENTH WORLD</strong>
        <br />
        Explore a world shrouded in mystery. Discover distinct environments with
        unique enemies to battle, resources to gather and secrets to uncover! Be
        a viking, sail the open seas in search of lands unknown, and fight
        bloodthirsty monsters.

        <strong>BUILD MIGHTY HALLS</strong>
        <br />
        Raise viking longhouses and build bases that offer reprieve from the
        dangers ahead. Customise buildings, both inside and out, with a detailed
        building system. Progress through building tiers to upgrade, expand and
        defend your base.

        tools, ships, and defenses. Decorate your hearths and sharpen your
        blades, grow crops and vegetables, prepare food, brew meads and potions,
        and progress as you defeat more difficult bosses and discover new
        recipes and blueprints.
