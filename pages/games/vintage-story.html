    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
      Vintage Story is an <strong>uncompromising</strong> wilderness
      <strong>survival sandbox</strong> game inspired by
      <strong>lovecraftian</strong> horror themes. Find yourself in a ruined
      world reclaimed by nature and permeated by unnerving temporal
      disturbances. Relive the advent of human civilization, or take your own
      path.

        <strong>Progress through multiple ages</strong>
        <br />
        Start out empty-handed in the stone age and learn to survive by
        foraging, hunting, crafting, and fighting. Live through the four seasons
        and advance further by smelting copper for more powerful tools, creating
        bronze alloys, learning to work iron, mechanize common tasks and
        ultimately reach the steel age.

      <p>
        <strong>A wicked universe backed by original story elements</strong>
        <br />
        Take on the role of a lost being in the body of a tall blue creature and
        discover the remnants of civilization. There is no linear storytelling;
        it is up to you to piece together who you are and what has happened from
        the little evidence that remains. During your journey you will encounter
        wayward creatures, find old stories, battle temporal instability, and
        endure temporal storms.

        <br />
        Enter a vast open world populated by a range of cute, strange,
        dangerous, and horrifying creatures. Vintage Story utilizes a great deal
        of procedural technology to create immensely diverse landscapes, climate
        conditions, and geological features to always keep exploration fresh and
        exciting.
