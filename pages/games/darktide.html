      <h2>Gameplay Features</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>HIGH OCTANE HYBRID COMBAT</strong>
        <br />
        To survive in Tertium, players will need to master both
        <strong>melee</strong> and <strong>ranged combat</strong> , switching
        seamlessly between the two as the need arises.Every encounter pits you
        against a variety of enemies, each with their own fighting style. It'll
        be up to you to determine how best to take them down using the weapons
        at your disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A HIVE CITY ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE</strong>
        <br />
        From boiling hot industrial factories to the decaying water maintenance
        zone afflicted by constant acid rainfall - Tertium Hive is a hard and
        unforgiving place even at the best of times. The rich lore of Darktide
        is felt everywhere in the game - from the moment you create your
        character, to the incredible scale you will feel when exploring Tertium,
        to the over 85 000 lines of voice acted dialogue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DIE ALONE OR SUFFER TOGETHER</strong>
        <br />
        At its core, Darktide is a co-op game. Wandering too far, risks
        punishment by foes looking to immobilize or capture stray Rejects, such
        as the slavering Chaos Hound or the Moebian Trapper. Once you fall prey
        to such foes, only your teammates can save you! More than that, your
        innate toughness - your determination to press on through the pain -
        only recharges when you are in the proximity of your strike team.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CHAOS NEVER SLEEPS</strong>
        <br />
        The threat of Chaos is not so easily defeated and the Battle for Tertium
        is just the beginning. In the coming weeks, months, and years the
        Darktide universe will grow, bringing with it new classes, missions,
        enemies & allies, and much more!

    <!-- Classes -->
    <section>
      <h2>Classes</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>VETERAN</strong>
        <br />
        Veteran: Sharpshooters epitomize the Astra Militarum's combat doctrine:
        overwhelming firepower honed through training and delivered
        unflinchingly in the heat of battle. The Sharpshooter specializes in
        ranged combat drills, keeping the foe at a distance while bringing
        firepower to bear against high-priority targets. Though they can spray
        and pray with the best of them, the Sharpshooter is at their most
        dangerous when they take the time to place their shots where the enemy
        is vulnerable. Breathe in. Breathe out. Blow them away.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>PSYKER</strong>
        <br />
        Psykers' abilities are tied to the disciplines they learn to stave off
        madness and control their otherworldly gifts. Such disciplines run the
        gamut from showstopping to subtle, depending on the Psyker's personality
        and tutelage.Psykinetics manipulate empyrean forces with the power of
        their mind, repurposing it to crush heads and inflict gnawing agony on
        their victims. They leave a trail of mangled bodies in their wake … most
        of whom never had a chance to react to their danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ZEALOT PREACHER</strong>
        <br />
        Zealot: Preachers yearn for the release of death and arrival before the
        Golden Throne. Alas, it seems the Emperor yet has need of them in the
        mortal world and so they fight on, blows emboldened by pious rage as
        their lifeforce ebbs, and fury heightened by the knowledge that each
        scrap of pain brings them closer to reward.Preachers care not if they
        live or die, so long as the foe is vanquished. Their faith hardens as
        they suffer injury grow weaker, empowering attacks with holy wrath and
        strengthening their will to fight on!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>OGRYN SKULLBREAKER</strong>
        <br />
        A skullbreaker leans into the Ogryn's foremost attribute: its prodigious
        strength. He loves nothing more than to charge into the thick of the
        fighting, shouldering aside any “punies” that get in his path to deliver
        punishing, shattering blows against his chosen target. Often while
        laughing as the tiny, tiny foes tire themselves out flailing at him in
        return.
        <br />
        It's not subtle, but it's definitely effective. <br />
        More importantly, it's fun. Ogryns like having fun.
