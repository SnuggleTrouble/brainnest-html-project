    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <p>
        Subnautica is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean planet.
        A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dive Into a Vast Underwater World</strong>
        <br />
        You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is
        down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to
        treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent
        underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp
        forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with
        life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scavenge, Craft, and Survive</strong>
        <br />
        After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find
        water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect
        resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat
        modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer
        resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Construct Underwater Habitats</strong>
        <br />
        Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage
        hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store
        resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore
        the vast ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Unravel the Mystery</strong>
        <br />
        What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right.
        What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the
        mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to
        make it off the planet alive?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disrupt the Food Chain</strong>
        <br />
        The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and
        distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as
        fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Handle the Pressure</strong>
        <br />
        Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and
        explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills,
        torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fear the Night</strong>
        <br />
        As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving
        of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to
        explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a
        beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dive Below the Ocean Floor</strong>
        <br />
        Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages
        to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows.
        Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels,
        and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>WARNING</strong>
        <br />
        This game contains flashing lights that may make it unsuitable for
        people with photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitive conditions.
